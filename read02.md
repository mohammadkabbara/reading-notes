**github and git**

Git is a little intimidating at first but embodies a very simple idea. As described on its website, Git is essentially a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

*In other words:*

It allows groups of developers to collaborate on the same documents (often source code) simultaneously and without overriding each other’s work.

Version control is “a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.”

**where does ‘GitHub’ come into it?****

Depending on who you talk to, GitHub can be referred to as multiple different things:

1- publishing tool

2- version control system

3- collaboration tool
